## My experience

I am currently working as a manual QA and also as project manager assistant on some projects. I work in outsourcing, so multitasking and switching is something I know, can do and practise every day. I like to see things through to the end and love my projects. We bring each of them together with the team to get the best results and see positive feedback from the client
